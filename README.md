# JIIT-CLONE-WEBSITE

<h4>Hello Everyone,I created a JIIT front-end non-responsive website. It is my first project using languages HTML / CSS / JS . Being non-responsive, It would be a little distorted on your device. </h4>
<h4>I tried to add basic operations using javascript to make the website a little interactive so play around with it a little to expolore more </h4>
<h4>This project is not for marketing purpose and none of it is my original design but a mere copy of the original website which I tried to make.</h4>
<h3>THANK YOU</h3>
